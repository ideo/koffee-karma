# Koffee Karma Master Tracker (Fully Updated + Behaviors)

This document meticulously tracks the development tasks and **intended behaviors**, categorized clearly, based on the Slackbot project using Bolt (Node.js) and Firebase Firestore.

| Button Behaviors | Claim button - requester cannot claim own order | ‚úÖ Done | High | Ephemeral message shown if attempted (developer override exists). |
| Button Behaviors | Cancel button - only requester can cancel | ‚úÖ Done | High | Checked in handler; ephemeral message sent if invalid user. |
| Button Behaviors | Mark as Delivered - runner or receiver only | ‚úÖ Done | High | Checked in handler (runner only currently); ephemeral message sent if invalid user. |
| Button Behaviors | Order Now - only requester (not runner) can order | ‚úÖ Done | High | Block runner from ordering own availability (checked in `handleOrderSubmission` targeted flow). |

# Additional Notes

- Bonus karma multiplier is triggered at **mark-as-delivered** time.
- Runner capabilities are **stored as arrays**.
- Timers: `/order` = 10 minutes, `/deliver` = 5/10/15 minutes. Timer text uses `floor()`. Timer updates driven by `createdAt`.
- Redemption codes allow flexible limits.
- Runner validation during ORDER NOW flow dynamically restricts drink categories.
- Karma titles pulled live from Firestore.
