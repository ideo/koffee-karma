# Koffee Karma Master Tracker (Fully Updated + Behaviors)

## Intended Behaviors & Data Flows

# Additional Notes

- **Tone of Voice / Aesthetic:** A specific "punk" aesthetic (serious, raw, stylized, no exclamation marks, sparse emojis, mix of casing) has been applied to most user-facing text elements (modals, buttons, errors, DMs, command outputs). The main block-kit order/runner messages were excluded from this styling. See `USER_FACING_TEXT copy.md` for details. Verified no exclamation marks in recent handlers.
- Bonus karma multiplier is triggered at **mark-as-delivered** time.
- Runner capabilities are **stored as arrays**.
- Timers: `/order` = 10 minutes, `/deliver` = 5/10/15 minutes. **Timer text uses `Math.ceil()` to round up.** Timer updates driven by `createdAt` or `timeClaimed`. Order timer updates active; Offer timer updates implemented.
- Redemption codes allow flexible limits.
- Runner validation during ORDER NOW flow dynamically restricts drink categories.
- Title system based on Reputation (logic TBD).

- Reputation is a cumulative, non-decreasing score that tracks total engagement. Requesters earn Reputation equal to the amount spent when an order is delivered; runners earn Reputation equal to what they receive (including bonus). This metric is used for leaderboard rankings.
